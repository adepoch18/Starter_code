Before doing this, review the **8. 2-way Anova** lecture set slides from
<https://sites.google.com/view/biostats/bioenv-2100/2-way-anovas-and-interactions>
and the **8\_Blocking\_and\_interactions.R** script in the lecture files
folder of the [CUNY-BioStats github
repository](https://github.com/jsgosnell/CUNY-BioStats). Make sure you
are comfortable with null and alternative hypotheses for all examples.

Remember you should

  - add code chunks by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar
    or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I* to answer the questions\!
  - **knit** your file to produce a markdown version that you can see\!
  - save your work often
      - **commit** it via git\!
      - **push** updates to github

1.  A survey was conducted to see if athletes and non-athletes deal with
    anger in the same way. Data is @

angry \<-
read.csv(“<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsgosnell/CUNY-BioStats/master/datasets/angry_moods.csv>”,
stringsAsFactors = T)

and more information is at

<http://onlinestatbook.com/case_studies/angry_moods.html>.

Focus on the following variables:

Sports 1 = athletes, 2 = non-athletes Gender 1 = males, 2 = females
Expression (AE) index of general anger expression: (Anger-Out) +
(Anger-In) - (Control-Out) - (Control-In) + 48

Is there any evidence that gender or athlete status impact how anger is
expressed?

2.  A professor carried out a long-term study to see how various factors
    impacted pulse rate before and after exercise. Data can be found at
    <http://www.statsci.org/data/oz/ms212.txt> With more info at
    <http://www.statsci.org/data/oz/ms212.html>. Is there evidence that
    frequency of exercise (Exercise column) and gender impact change in
    pulse rate for studetns who ran (Ran column = 1)?

3.  (Continuing from question 2) I’m curious if the treatment (running
    vs not) even had an impact, and if so did it depend on gender. How
    would you test this?
