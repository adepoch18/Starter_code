Before doing this, review the **Introduction To Hypothesis Testing Via Binomial Tests** lecture set slides from 
https://sites.google.com/view/biostats/bioenv-2100/hypothesis-testing-with-the-binomial-distribution and
the  **3_hypothesis_testing_and_binomial.R** script in the lecture_files folder of the
[CUNY-BioStats github repository](https://github.com/jsgosnell/CUNY-BioStats).


Remember you should

* add code chunks by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by
pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I* to answer the questions!
* **knit** your file to produce a markdown version that you can see!
* save your work often 
  * **commit** it via git!
  * **push** updates to github

## Hypothesis Testing and the Binomial Distribution

1. Are people eared (do they prefer one ear or another)?  Of 25 people observed 
while in conversation in a nightclub, 19 turned their right ear to the speaker 
and 6 turn their left ear to the speaker.  How strong is the evidence for 
eared-ness given this data (adapted from Analysis of Biological Data)?
* state a null and alternative hypothesis
* calculate a test statistic for this data
* Make you understand how to construct a null distribution
  + using sampling/simulation
  + by using an appropriate distribution
*Calculate and compare p-values obtained using 
  + simulation (calculation won’t be required on test, but make sure you understand!)
  + equations for binomial distribution 
  + R functions
* Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of people who are right-eared
* How do your 95% confidence interval and hypothesis test compare?

2.  A professor lets his dog take every multiple-choice test to see how it 
compares to his students (I know someone who did this).  Unfortunately, the
professor believes undergraduates in the class tricked him by helping the dog 
do better on a test. It’s a 100 question test, and every questions has 4 answer 
choices.  For the last test, the dog picked 33 questions correctly.  How likely
is this to happen, and is there evidence the students helped the dog?	

MAKE SURE TO THINK ABOUT YOUR TEST OPTIONS 

##Distribution and Bayes

3. Review the videos we watched in class

4. I've shared a script in R that lets you test the Monty Hall idea (like in 
the video!).  It's the chivers_monty_hall_script from the 
[code_examples folder](https://github.com/jsgosnell/CUNY-BioStats/tree/master/code_examples)code_examples  
on github.  For this question, its easiest to just source the main file and see what happens.
When you source a script, it is run in R without showing any console output
(but graphs and objects are still produced!).  Try 
*source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsgosnell/CUNY-BioStats/master/code_examples/chivers_monty_hall_script.R")*
, then test out the idea here using the following functions which calculate outcomes
under each strategy.
* monty(strat="stay")
* monty(strat="switch")
* monty(strat="random")

5. Setup the Monty Hall problem as probabilities and convince yourself how it works.
You may want to remember to think about prior and new information (likelihoods).

6. Run the frog analysis (14/18 frogs are right-pawed) assuming an “uninformed” 
prior (is this really possible?) and priors that predict frogs are likely to be 
left- or right-handed (look under Bayesian analysis in script for functions such
as triplot and qbeta).  Vary both the relationship among the shape variables 
and the magnitude (weighting) to understand how the prior impacts your posterior.
