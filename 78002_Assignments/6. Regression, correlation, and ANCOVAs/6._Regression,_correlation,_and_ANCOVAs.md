Before doing this, review the **Week 65** lecture set slides from
<https://sites.google.com/view/biostats/bio-7800178002/week-6> and the
**9\_Regression\_and\_correlation.R** and
**10\_ANCOVA\_and\_Regression.R (up to line 248)** script in the lecture
files folder of the [CUNY-BioStats github
repository](https://github.com/jsgosnell/CUNY-BioStats). Make sure you
are comfortable with null and alternative hypotheses for all examples
and understand correlation vs regression.

Remember you should

  - add code chunks by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar
    or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I* to answer the questions\!
  - **knit** your file to produce a markdown version that you can see\!
  - save your work often
      - **commit** it via git\!
      - **push** updates to github

1.  A professor carried out a long-term study to see how various factors
    impacted pulse rate before and after exercise. Data can be found at

<http://www.statsci.org/data/oz/ms212.txt>

With more info at

<http://www.statsci.org/data/oz/ms212.html>.

Is there evidence that age, height, or weight impact change in pulse
rate for students who ran (Ran column = 1)?

2.  (from OZDASL repository,
    <http://www.statsci.org/data/general/stature.html>; reference for
    more information)

When anthropologists analyze human skeletal remains, an important piece
of information is living stature. Since skeletons are commonly based on
statistical methods that utilize measurements on small bones. The
following data was presented in a paper in the American Journal of
Physical Anthropology to validate one such method. Data is available @

<http://www.statsci.org/data/general/stature.txt>

as a tab-delimted file (need to use read.table\!) Is there evidence that
metacarpal bone length is a good predictor of stature? If so, how much
variation does it account for in the response variable?

3.  Data on medals won by various countries in the 1992 and 1994
    Olympics is available in a tab-delimited file at

<http://www.statsci.org/data/oz/medals.txt>

More information on the data can be found at:

<http://www.statsci.org/data/oz/medals.html>

Is there any relationship between a countryâ€™s population and the total
number of medals they win?

4.  Continuing with the Olympic data, is there a relationship between
    the latitude of a country and the number of medals won in summer or
    winter Olympics?

5.  Data on FEV (forced expiratory volume), a measure of lung function,
    can be found at

<http://www.statsci.org/data/general/fev.txt>

More information on the dataset is available at

<http://www.statsci.org/data/general/fev.html>.

Is there evidence that FEV depends on age or height? If so, how do these
factors impact FEV, and how much variance does each explain?

6.  Continuing with the FEV data, produce plots that illustrate how
    height, age, and gender each impact FEV.

7.  Does the impact of age on FEV differ among genders?

8.  Data on home gas consumption at various temperatures before and
    after new insulation was installed has been collected @

<http://www.statsci.org/data/general/insulgas.txt>

More information on the data is available @

<http://www.statsci.org/data/general/insulgas.html>

Is there any relationship between these factors? How would you test
this, and what type of plot would you produce to accompany your
analysis?
