Before doing this, review the **Week 5** lecture set slides from
<https://sites.google.com/view/biostats/bio-7800178002/week-5> and the
**7\_ANOVAs.R** and **8\_Blocking\_and\_interactions.R** script in the
lecture files folder of the [CUNY-BioStats github
repository](https://github.com/jsgosnell/CUNY-BioStats).

Remember you should

  - add code chunks by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar
    or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I* to answer the questions\!
  - **knit** your file to produce a markdown version that you can see\!
  - save your work often
      - **commit** it via git\!
      - **push** updates to github

## Just for practice. Do this problems using ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, and bootstrapping methods. Make sure you can plot the data and carry out multiple comparison methods as needed. Also be sure to understand the use of coefficients and adjusted R<sup>2</sup> values and where to find them.

1.  Use the iris dataset in R to determine if petal length differs among
    species.

## t-tests are special cases of ANOVAs, which are special cases of linear models\!

2.  Data on plant heights (in cm) for plants grown with a new and old
    formulation of fertilizer can be found at

<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsgosnell/CUNY-BioStats/master/datasets/fertilizer.csv>.

Analyze this data using the t.test function and the lm function to
convince yourself the outcome is the same.

## For the following questions, pick the appropriate method for analyzing the question. Use a plot of the data and/or model analysis to justify your decision. Make sure you can carry out multiple comparison methods as needed. Also be sure to understand the use of coefficients and adjusted R<sup>2</sup> values and where to find them.

3.  Data on sugar cane yield for multiple fields is available using

read.table(“<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsgosnell/CUNY-BioStats/master/datasets/cane.txt>”,
header = T, stringasFactors = T)

More info on the data can be found at
<http://www.statsci.org/data/oz/cane.html>. Is there evidence that
location (DistrictPosition column) impacts yield (Tonn.Hect column)? If
so, which areas are driving this distance?

4.  Data on FEV (forced expiratory volume), a measure of lung function,
    can be found at <http://www.statsci.org/data/general/fev.txt> More
    information on the dataset is available at
    <http://www.statsci.org/data/general/fev.html>. Is there evidence
    that FEV depends on gender? If so, which gender has the higher FEV
    score? How much variance does gender explain?

5.  A professor carried out a long-term study to see how various factors
    impacted pulse rate before and after exercise. Data can be found at
    <http://www.statsci.org/data/oz/ms212.txt> With more info at
    <http://www.statsci.org/data/oz/ms212.html>. Is there evidence that
    frequency of exercise (Exercise column) impacts resting pulse rate
    (Pulse1 column)?

6.  Continuing with the pulse dataset, is there evidence frequency of
    exercise impacts change in pulse rate? Note we should only consider
    change for students who ran between the first and second pulse
    measures (Ran column = 1).

7.  A survey was conducted to see if athletes and non-athletes deal with
    anger in the same way. Data is @

angry \<-
read.csv(“<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsgosnell/CUNY-BioStats/master/datasets/angry_moods.csv>”,
stringsAsFactors = T)

and more information is at

<http://onlinestatbook.com/case_studies/angry_moods.html>.

Focus on the following variables:

Sports 1 = athletes, 2 = non-athletes Gender 1 = males, 2 = females
Expression (AE) index of general anger expression: (Anger-Out) +
(Anger-In) - (Control-Out) - (Control-In) + 48

Is there any evidence that gender or athlete status impact how anger is
expressed?

8.  Back to the pulse data (\#5). Is there evidence that frequency of
    exercise (Exercise column) and gender impact change in pulse rate
    for studetns who ran (Ran column = 1)?

9.  (Continuing from question 9) I’m curious if the treatment (running
    vs not) even had an impact, and if so did it depend on gender. How
    would you test this?
